**What can you do with this UI?**
---
You can utilize various machine learning techniques such as:

- Classification: Predicting categories for your data, such as churn prediction, purchase likelihood, and more.
- Regression: Modeling relationships between variables to make continuous predictions.
- Clustering: Grouping similar data points together based on their features.

**Can you perform multiclass classification?**
---
Currently, our system supports binary classification. However, if you require multiclass classification capabilities, simply let us know, and we'll incorporate it for you!

## **What models are available?**
---
We offer a range of models to suit your needs, including:

**Classification**
  ---------
K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Support Vector Machines (SVM)

**Regression**
  ---------
K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Decision Trees, Linear Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Ridge, Lasso

**Clustering**
  ---------
K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Agglomerative Clustering, DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)

## **Is deep learning supported?**
---
While deep learning capabilities are not yet available, I'm continuously improving my system to include neural networks and other deep learning algorithms in the future.

## **Getting Started**
-----
To get started, simply deploy the UI using Streamlit and input your data. You'll be guided through the process of selecting models, tuning parameters, and making predictions effortlessly.
Enjoy exploring the world of machine learning with our intuitive UI!
